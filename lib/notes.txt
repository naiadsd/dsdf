For those who are not iOS devs and stumble upon this hoping that it resolves the issue. I had trouble running my project with flutter run after making the changes here.

I was able to resolve the issue by editing my Release.xcconfig file to add these two lines at the bottom:

#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.release.xcconfig"
#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.profile.xcconfig"
Then I added this line to the bottom of my Debug.xcconfig

#include "Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-Runner/Pods-Runner.debug.xcconfig"
For those looking for these two files in XCode, here is where I found them:

After doing this, pod install worked just fine and so did flutter run. Hopefully, this saves someone else a headache.

Other notes, I am using XCode 12 and Flutter 1.22.2
